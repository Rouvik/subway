# Subway
A simple express like HTTP 1.1 web server

# Note:
This is just an experiment and a learning endeavour, using RegEx-es is actually quite impractical for large complex
projects, as they carry their own major complexes and are prone to crasing if implemented badly(greedy capture and replace going into infinite loops), thus not much should be expected.

# Features/Goals:
- Express like routes which make development simpler and easier (under construction)
- Make a web server that explicitly supports RegEx as its URI/URL matcher
- Make a web server that can host a file system in less than 5 lines (we can already do that!)
